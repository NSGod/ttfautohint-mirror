The ttfautohint library is copyrighted work and cannot be used legally
without a software license.  Since it is largely based on FreeType, the same
license conditions are used.

In order to make this project usable to a vast majority of developers, the
ttfautohint library is distributed under two mutually exclusive open-source
licenses.

This means that *you* must choose *one* of the two licenses described below,
then obey all its terms and conditions when using the ttfautohint library in
any of your projects or products.

 - The FreeType License, found in the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
   to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces you
   to explicitly cite the ttfautohint library in your product's
   documentation.  All details are in the license file.  This license is
   suited to products which don't use the GNU General Public License.

   Note that this license is compatible to the GNU General Public License
   version 3, but not version 2.

 - The GNU General Public License version 2, found in `GPLv2.TXT' (any later
   version can be used also), for programs which already use the GPL.

The following files are distributed with the source bundle of the
ttfautohint library to configure and build the library with GNU tools, but
which aren't part of it due to a different license (GPL only).

  bootstrap
  bootstrap.conf
  m4/ltlize_lang.m4

All files of the following directories are distributed with the source
bundle of the ttfautohint library to configure and build the library with
GNU tools, but which aren't part of it due to a different license (GPL
only).
