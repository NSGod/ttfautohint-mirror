New in 0.5:

* Rendering on iOS is now expected to give good results.

* No bad rendering at very large PPEM values.


New in 0.4:

* The bytecode has been changed to `create' twilight points.  This should
  avoid rendering artifacts on some platforms.


New in 0.3:

* Fix font generation; sometimes the `glyf' table was one byte too short,
  making the font invalid.


New in 0.2:

* Fix bytecode bugs which prevented correct rendering on some platforms.


New in 0.1:

* First release.
