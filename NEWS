New in 0.7:

* A GUI has been added, using the Qt framework.  The binary is called
  `ttfautohintGUI'.

New in 0.6.1:

* The improved handling of composite glyphs in 0.6 was buggy under certain
  circumstances, making ttfautohint crash and FontValidator complain.

* Dropout handling has been activated.


New in 0.6:

* Improved handling of composite glyphs.

* Implement option `-p' to pre-hint glyphs with original hints before
  conversion takes place.

* Don't add a DSIG table if there is none in the input font.

* Human-readable error messages instead of hexadecimal error codes.

* Better tests (both at runtime and compile time) to reject too old FreeType
  versions.


New in 0.5:

* Rendering on iOS is now expected to give good results.

* No bad rendering at very large PPEM values.


New in 0.4:

* The bytecode has been changed to `create' twilight points.  This should
  avoid rendering artifacts on some platforms.


New in 0.3:

* Fix font generation; sometimes the `glyf' table was one byte too short,
  making the font invalid.


New in 0.2:

* Fix bytecode bugs which prevented correct rendering on some platforms.


New in 0.1:

* First release.
