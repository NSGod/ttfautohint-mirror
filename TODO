simplify hinting bytecode by using the undocumented properties of some
  instructions to shift the original coordinates of twilight points
  (as confirmed by Greg)

testing with Windows font checker

man page for ttfautohint library?
install library?

`modified' field in `head'
`lowestRecPPEM' field in `head'

handling OT features -> use HarfBuzz?

controlling `gasp' table

controlling activation threshold of blue zone widths

controlling the width of blue zones

handle normal and bold fonts differently; cf. Infinality patches

Implementing `x-height-snapping-exceptions' and `pre-hinting'.

write a platform-independent GUI

add CJK autohinting module?

hinting in x direction also?
  -> warper: shifting with and without scaling
  -> `standard' autofit hinting

try to reduce size of hints by handling strong points separately

add a config and/or command file for batch handling

allow hinting of single glyphs, using a config file which holds the global
settings

instead of emitting bytecode, write the hints as a VTT or FontLab script?

make creation of DSIG table optional
