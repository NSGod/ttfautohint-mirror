essential fixes
---------------

simplify hinting bytecode by using the undocumented properties of some
  instructions to shift the original coordinates of twilight points; this
  should also fix the rendering problems on platforms like OS X.

explicitly check for new functionality of `FT_Sfnt_Table_Info'

write a platform-independent GUI
  -> direct control over `actions'
  -> preview similar to ftgrid


important improvements
----------------------

handle OT features
  -> use HarfBuzz?

control `gasp' table

control activation threshold of blue zone widths

control the width of blue zones

handle normal and bold fonts differently; cf. Infinality patches

implement `x-height-snapping-exceptions' and `pre-hinting'

allow hinting of single glyphs, using a config file which holds the global
  settings


minor improvements
------------------

make FreeType error codes human-readable

correctly set `modified' field in `head'

correctly set `lowestRecPPEM' field in `head'

set dropout mode et al.

apply hinting in x direction also?
  -> warper: shifting with and without scaling
  -> `standard' autofit hinting

try to reduce size of hints by handling strong points separately

add a config and/or command file for batch handling

make creation of DSIG table optional


later enhancements
------------------

add CJK autohinting module
add Hebrew autohinting module

instead of emitting bytecode, write the hints as a VTT or FontLab script
