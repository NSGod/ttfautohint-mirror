The ttfautohint library is copyrighted work and cannot be used legally
without a software license.  Since it is largely based on FreeType, the same
license conditions are used.

In order to make this project usable to a vast majority of developers,
ttfautohint is distributed under two mutually exclusive open-source
licenses.

This means that *you* must choose *one* of the two licenses described below,
then obey all its terms and conditions when using ttfautohint in any of your
projects or products.

 - The FreeType License, found in the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
   to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces you
   to explicitly cite ttfautohint in your product's documentation.  All
   details are in the license file.  This license is suited to products
   which don't use the GNU General Public License.

   Note that this license is compatible to the GNU General Public License
   version 3, but not version 2.

 - The GNU General Public License version 2, found in `GPLv2.TXT' (any later
   version can be used also), for programs which already use the GPL.
