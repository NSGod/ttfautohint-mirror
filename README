ttfautohint 0.1
---------------

by Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>


This project provides a library which takes a TrueType font as the input,
remove its bytecode instructions (if any), and return a new font where all
glyphs are bytecode hinted using the information given by FreeType's
autohinting module.  The idea is to provide the excellent quality of the
autohinter on platforms which don't use FreeType.

The library has a single API function, `TTF_autohint', which takes two
parameters, `in' and `out', together with a constant string specifying
options to control the conversion.
