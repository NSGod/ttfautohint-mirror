ttfautohint 0.2
---------------

by Werner Lemberg <wl@gnu.org>


This project provides a library which takes a TrueType font as the input,
remove its bytecode instructions (if any), and return a new font where all
glyphs are bytecode hinted using the information given by FreeType's
autohinting module.  The idea is to provide the excellent quality of the
autohinter on platforms which don't use FreeType.

The library has a single API function, `TTF_autohint'; see
`src/ttfautohint.h' for a detailed description.  Note that the library
itself won't get installed currently.

A simple command-line interface to the library is the demo program
`ttfautohint'; after compilation and installation, say

  ttfautohint --help

for usage information, or say

  man ttfautohint

to read its manual page.
