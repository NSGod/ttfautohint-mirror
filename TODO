essential fixes
---------------

simplify hinting bytecode by using the undocumented properties of some
  instructions to shift the original coordinates of twilight points; this
  should also fix the rendering problems on platforms like OS X.

explicitly check for new functionality of `FT_Sfnt_Table_Info'

write a platform-independent GUI
  -> direct control over `actions'
  -> preview similar to ftgrid


important improvements
----------------------

handle OT features
  -> use HarfBuzz?

control `gasp' table; Adam Twardoch suggest the following:

  1. Calculate "gaspstem", i.e. the most common thickness of horizontal
     stems (y-direction distances) for lowercase Latin letters.
  2. If gaspstem <= 0.03 * upm, apply gasp symmetric smoothing across the
     entire range (rangeMaxPPEM 0xFFFF, value 15)
  3. Else, calculate gaspthreshold as follows:
       ceil(1.33 * upm / gaspstem) - 1
  4. Apply no symmetric smoothing up to the gaspthreshold ppem (rangeMaxPPEM
     gaspthreshold, value 7), and apply symmetric smoothing above.

  In addition, ttfautohint should provide a commandline parameter that
  allows the user to override the automatic logic.  If that parameter = 0,
  then gasp value 15 should be applied across the entire range.  If the
  parameter > 0, then up to that parameter value the gasp value 7 should be
  applied, and gasp value 15 should be applied above.

disable hinting at large ppem values (> ~2000) to avoid numeric overflows

control dropout mode

control activation threshold of blue zone widths

control the width of blue zones

handle normal and bold fonts differently; cf. Infinality patches

control the minimum stem width

try to `embolden' fonts at small sizes to avoid drop-outs; cf. Infinality
  patches

implement `x-height-snapping-exceptions' and `pre-hinting'

allow hinting of single glyphs, using a config file which holds the global
  settings

better handling of `incomplete' fonts (this is, fonts which lack the minimum
  set of glyphs necessary to determine the blue zones)


minor improvements
------------------

make FreeType error codes human-readable

correctly set `modified' field in `head'

correctly set `lowestRecPPEM' field in `head'

set dropout mode et al.

apply hinting in x direction also?
  -> warper: shifting with and without scaling
  -> `standard' autofit hinting

try to reduce size of hints by handling strong points separately

add a config and/or command file for batch handling

make creation of DSIG table optional


later enhancements
------------------

add CJK autohinting module
add Hebrew autohinting module

instead of emitting bytecode, write the hints as a VTT or FontLab script
