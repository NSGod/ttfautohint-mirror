building and installing ttfautohint from git
--------------------------------------------

Building ttfautohint from the git repository needs some tools which are not
required when building from a release:

  autoconf (2.65)
  automake (1.13)
  git (1.5.5)
  libtool (2.2.2)

If you configure to build the documentation files also (which are normally
distributed with the release package), the following is necessary:

  help2man (1.40.1)
  pandoc (1.11.1)
  inkscape (0.48.2)
  X11
  ImageMagick (6.7.4)
  pdflatex (TeXLive 2011)

The version numbers in parentheses are known to work.  Newer versions should
work also.

Say

  ./bootstrap

to clone the `gnulib' repository (which gets installed as a git submodule),
to build the `configure' script, and to set up necessary auxiliary files. 
Then you can proceed with the instructions given in the `INSTALL' file with
the exception that parellel builds with `make -j' are not supported yet.

Some additional remarks for compilation within the MinGW environment.

  o Since MSYS, the shell of MinGW, uses LF as line endings, `git checkout'
    should not convert files to CRLF.  Before checking out the FreeType and
    ttfautohint repositories, you should issue the command

      git config --global core.autocrlf input

    to avoid any line ending conversion.

  o At the time of this writing (January 2012), compilation of FreeType with
    gcc bundles 4.6.1-2 or 4.6.2-1 fail.  Instead, you should use version
    4.5.2-1.  Unfortunately, mingw-get is not able yet to download and
    install a particular version; it always installs the newest one.  Some
    manual work is necessary to overcome this restriction, as described by
    Keith Marshall (in
    http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=28753845):

      > So what's the trick to access a specific release in a meta data
      > file?

      At present, the only way is to manually edit the XML manifest file,
      (it is $MINGW_GET_ROOT/var/lib/mingw-get/data/mingw32-gcc4.xml), to
      remove all of the <release ... /> references for any versions which
      are newer, (i.e.  have a greater version number), than the particular
      one you want to install.

      If you would also like to preserve such changes, so that they will not
      be reverted by a subsequent 'mingw-get update', then you may wish to
      change the issue attribute, in the <software-distribution ...  /> tag,
      from issue="2011122200" to something like issue="ZZZZZZZZZZ".

  o To compile a stand-alone version of ttfautohint, first compile a static
    version of Qt.  I've successfully followed these instructions:

      http://www.formortals.com/build-qt-static-small-microsoft-intel-gcc-compiler/

    Now configure and compile ttfautohint using

      configure --with-qt=DIR
      make LDFLAGS=-all-static
