# make-snapshot.sh <application> <filename>
#
# Make a snapshot from an application's start window and save it to a file.
# This needs X11 and ImageMagick's `import' tool.
#
# This script is very simple.  Some possible problems:
#
# o In case the program doesn't create a visible X11 window, you have to
#   abort the script with ^C.
#
# o It fails for intelligent applications like `firefox' in case they are
#   already run, since firefox replaces the process with a new window of the
#   already running instance.
#
# o It loops forever for programs like `k3b' which spawns itself, thus
#   having a different process ID for the visible window.


# This script uses ideas from
# http://blog.chewearn.com/2010/01/18/find-window-id-of-a-process-id-in-bash-script/.
