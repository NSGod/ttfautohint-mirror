ttfautohint

This project will eventually lead to a new library which takes a TrueType
font as the input, remove its bytecode instructions (if any), and return a
new font where all glyphs are bytecode hinted using the information given by
FreeType's autohinting module.  The idea is to provide the excellent quality
of the autohinter on platforms which don't use FreeType.

Right now, I'm still in a phase of collecting ideas, analyzing previous art. 
In particular, I've already examined the TrueType auto-instructor of
FontForge (written originally by Micha≈Ç Nowakowski), but this is too tightly
integrated into FontForge to be of much help currently.

Note that, contrary to the autohinter, generating such fonts is not a
time-critical issue.  In other words, it might be possible (probably in a
follow-up project) to add further, more time-consuming analysis to the glyph
shapes for improving the output bytecode.

Ideas, suggestions, comments are highly welcomed!  I'm especially interested
in thoughts how possible function parameters might look like to control the
generation of the hints.  Currently, it would be a black box process
(essentially the same as the autohinter).
